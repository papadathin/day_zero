An informative Web App about Water Scarcity was created as a project for the university course “Web Information Systems”. During this project the team focused both on the front-end and back-end parts of Web Apps.

It is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

It consists of a home page, 3 informative pages (causes, effects, what is happening), a functional contact form, search page, a log in/ sign in system, a server, and a database.

Also, the Web App is mobile friendly.
